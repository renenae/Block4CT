Programming Experience:
I know how to do basic things in python and HTML we learned a lot of things the past semesters with Mr.Best and in 9th grade. We made a gorcery list program that wrote down things for people so thst they could order them etc. 
I really want to improve in making programs and review the things that make them like tuples strings etc. 
Something that challenges me alot is making and writing programs since i dont know where to start and where to go after I acomplish something
One of my goals is to just get better in general with coding and just smooth out the edges
